    <p>
      In 2001, Regina Schrambling went on a week long odyssey in search of the
      best lasagna recipe. Her ideal here has an intensely flavored sauce,
      cheeses melted into creaminess as if they were bechamel, meat thatâ€™s just
      chunky enough and noodles that put up no resistance to the fork.
